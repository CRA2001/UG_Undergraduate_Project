## Description

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have revolutionized the way healthcare providers manage patient information. They enable the collection, storage, and sharing of health data in a secure and efficient manner, resulting in better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. In this thesis, I present an EHR system developed using the Django framework, a powerful web development tool that facilitates rapid and scalable application development. Our system enables doctors and other healthcare professionals to securely store and access patient data, manage appointments and consultations, and generate reports. I also discuss the system's features, architecture, and implementation details, as well as its potential impact on the healthcare industry.
